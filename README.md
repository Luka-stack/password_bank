Password Bank
======


It's a small application that can keep passwords for multiple users.
Every user has own unique key for hashing their passwords.
The program has been written using different python libraries that are not in standard.


Feel free to download/fork, use it or manipulate the code :)

### Libraries

To run you need these libraries:
* cryptograpghy
* PySimpleGUI
* pyperclip

All of these can be installed using pip installer.


## Files

Program originally was written for Ubuntu and it is [pass_mang.py].
The second file [pass_mang_win.py] was slightly adjusted for Windows.
Additionally, I converted it into .exe file. To use it you need to download whole [bank_password] folder.
